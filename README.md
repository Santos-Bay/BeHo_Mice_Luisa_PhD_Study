# BeHo_Mice_Luisa_PhD_Study

I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Copenhagen. My PhD is atm entitled "The bugs and behaviours of animals – Hologenomics as a tool for studying the role of the gut microbiota in mammalian behaviour". The main aim of PhD thesis is to investigate how/if the gut microbiome influences animal behaviour using a hologenomic approach. I have two research studies in my PhD to assess this and they are called:
1. Fox study (alias: behavioural fox study, fox project)
2. Mice study (alias: BeHo study, BeHo project, behavioural hologenomics mice study)
Here I share the computational work (codes and results) of the BeHo project.

## Project description
Much evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences animal behaviour. Nevertheless, many behavioural traits have not been investigated yet, in particular those unassociated with diseases. Thus, in this study, we infer the behaviour dominance in J:DO laboratory mice (mus musculus) to test if the gut microbiome plays a role herein during different experimental treatments. Over the course of 14 weeks, we measured dominance of 80 mice in total, 40 of each sex, using a tube test to rank the dominance within a cage. Five males or five females were housed together per cage, and a hierarchy of dominance was therefore created ranking the individuals from 1 to 5, where 1 signified “most dominant” and 5 as “most submissive”. We further wanted to explore if the gut microbiome affects dominance under different biological conditions, such as changes in temperature or diet. Hence, the mice were exposed to five specific treatments, all known to interfere with the gut microbiome, each following a four day resting period for the mice to restore the potential unbalance caused (e.g. physiological or gut microbial). The order of treatments was i) an exposure to heat (temperature set to 34 degrees celsius), ii) an exposure to cold (temperature set to 14 degrees celsius), iii) a dietary change, where tryptophan was removed, iv) an antibiotic and antifungal treatment, and lastly, v) a fecal microbiota transplantation, where, among other, the feces from the most dominant animal was given to the most submissive, and vice versa, within each cage. However, one cage per sex were not exposed to any changes, and thus, they serve as control cages to examine what the gut microbes may have had of an effect on dominance without any disturbances.
